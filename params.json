For details on the license, see the LICENSE file.\r\n\r\n### SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\nThis project requires Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 running on Microsoft Windows.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n\r\nIt's pretty easy - just open the HTML5Boilerplate.csproj file, or add it into an\r\nexisting Visual Studio solution.\r\n\r\nGOING FURTHER\r\n\r\nTo add your own stuff into the project, please note just a few things:\r\n\r\n* The project currently supports HTML5Boilerplate 4, with jquery 1.8.2 and modernizr\r\n2.6.1.  For more details on some of the HTML5Boilerplate goodness check out that\r\nproject's home page at http://www.html5boilerplate.com.  \r\n\r\n* To add your own CSS, modify the \"Author's custom styles\" section of Content/main.css.\r\n\r\n* To modify the base view template, make your changes to Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml.\r\n\r\n* To add custom Javascript, modify Scripts/main.js.\r\n\r\n* To add jquery plugins, modify Scripts/plugins.js.\r\n\r\n* You can add a \"PreScripts\" section to your views for code that must execute BEFORE\r\nother Javascript libraries are loaded (e.g., jquery).  Note that the modernizr\r\nlibrary is always loaded before anything else.\r\n\r\n* You can add a \"PostScripts\" section for code that must execute AFTER other\r\nJavascript libraries are loaded.\r\n\r\n* Finally, if you want Google Analytics on your site, uncomment the Google Analytics\r\ncode in Views/Share/_Layout.cshtml and change UA-XXXXX-X to your Google Analytics\r\naccount number.\r\n\r\nThat's it!  Have fun, fork away, and ping me with questions if you need further help.\r\n\r\n### AUTHOR\r\n\r\nGerry Miller (gerry@gerrymiller.com)\r\nMuse Holdings, LLC\r\nRoyal Oak, Michigan, USA\r\nhttp://www.gerrymiller.com"}
