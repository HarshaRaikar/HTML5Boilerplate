INTRODUCTION

Hello and welcome to the MVC4 version of HTMLBoilerplate.

I created this project because I love HTML5Boilerplate, but there was no easy
way to integrate its coolness into Visual Studio and MVC4.

This Visual Studio 2012 project contains the complete HTML5Boilerplate version
4 as an MVC4 project.

LEGAL

This project is copyrighted open-source software that is released under the Apache
License, version 2.0.  For details on the license, see the LICENSE file.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

This project requires Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 running on Microsoft Windows.

INSTALLATION

It's pretty easy - just open the HTML5Boilerplate.csproj file, or add it into an
existing Visual Studio solution.

GOING FURTHER

To add your own stuff into the project, please note just a few things:

* The project currently supports HTML5Boilerplate 4, with jquery 1.8.2 and modernizr
2.6.1.  For more details on some of the HTML5Boilerplate goodness check out that
project's home page at http://www.html5boilerplate.com.  

* To add your own CSS, modify the "Author's custom styles" section of Content/main.css.

* To modify the base view template, make your changes to Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml.

* To add custom Javascript, modify Scripts/main.js.

* To add jquery plugins, modify Scripts/plugins.js.

* You can add a "PreScripts" section to your views for code that must execute BEFORE
other Javascript libraries are loaded (e.g., jquery).  Note that the modernizr
library is always loaded before anything else.

* You can add a "PostScripts" section for code that must execute AFTER other
Javascript libraries are loaded.

* Finally, if you want Google Analytics on your site, uncomment the Google Analytics
code in Views/Share/_Layout.cshtml and change UA-XXXXX-X to your Google Analytics
account number.

That's it!  Have fun, fork away, and ping me with questions if you need further help.
